Each scene will have a map parent
The map parent will have a script that uses the scene name to find the tile map information
The tile map file for each scene will have the references to the necessary 3d objects and their corresponding locations
The map parent will find this information and will generate the map based off of it.
The player information is stored in the playerData folder and the map parent will get that and will spawn in the player to the correct location
